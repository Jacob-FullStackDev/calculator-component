# Calculator Component

## About

- I built this to act as an auxillary project to my mental-workout project's mental math practice feature: [GitHub](https://github.com/Jacob-FullStackDev/mental-workout)

## Features

- Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, square roots, decimals
- Robust error handling for unintended actions
- Handled several edgecases such as division by 0, operands/results not being a number, result being too many digits or being larger than JavaScript's Max Safe Integer
- A history section for all your past expressions, and a button to clear them all

## Future Features

- Support more than one operand/2 operands
- Handle percentages

## Usage

- Click a number button to get started
- Adding a decimal followed by an operator will reassign it to the operator
- CE clears screen back to 0
- 0 can not be the first operand
- Only whole numbers can currently be rooted, and that edgecase is currently improperly handled
- If something goes wrong, there'll be either a warning or error in the browser console

## Footnotes

- To multiply numbers, I originally wanted to use an algorithm I made to multiply numbers in my head faster, however it is slower than the current approach and it wouldn't be consistent with how the other results are calculated so I did not add it, I instead decided to put it in a GitHub Gist if you are interested: [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/Jacob-FullStackDev/732819044e44296e5561c87e7b17b111)
